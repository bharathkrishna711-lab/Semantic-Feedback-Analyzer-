Thanks Andrew, As always you have been a superb teacher, I am very happy with the content of the course.One suggestion is to increase the level of difficulty in assignments. Or you can have one more course to develop an difficult deep learning application from scratch, through which we can all apply the concepts and tricks you explained.
