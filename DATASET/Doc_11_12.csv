review
"Thanks Andrew, As always you have been a superb teacher, I am very happy with the content of the course.One suggestion is to increase the level of difficulty in assignments. Or you can have one more course to develop an difficult deep learning application from scratch, through which we can all apply the concepts and tricks you explained."
the notebooks have a poor explanation of what should be done and unless you delete the last two cells every time you won't be able to submit
i had technical problems with both coursers's online system and also with the 3rd party online coding tool
I submitted all the labs and these are absolutely correct but still showing that I did not complete my task.
"It is pretty basic. The quizzes aren't so relevant all the time. Perhaps it does not involve much difficulty because it is meant for everyone, no matter from which field of work. The videos are nice though and worth watching for general knowledge."
"I realize Python is prerequisite, but there is very little Python instruction. At a minimum, it would have been very helpful if the professors explained the syntax of the python examples that are shown during lectures."
"the lectures are pretty great, engaging. the assignments stick with the lab exercise. the forum pretty active."
so much less example and more of lecture
I thini the course needs more quizzess and a program exercise
It isn't well explained how to share the notebook so many collegues failed the final test
"The course is pretty good and professor gives instructive lessons. However, in my opinion, 4 weeks of courses are relatively short and the content can be broaden to some degree. Anyway, it can be used as finance foundation course. I like it very much personally."
"This is the first deeplearning.ai course that I found really boring, maybe because the material presented was quite superfluous."
