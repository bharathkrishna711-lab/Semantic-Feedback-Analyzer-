review
There are gaps its content and Hong accent is very difficult to understand. I think security issues could be more deeper exposed.
"The teacher and lessons are excellent, but the auto-grader has some issues and doesn't give enough feedback."
"just a normal online course, the instructors are just reciting their ppt and prepared materials. Pretty boring."
Los subtitulos en ingles no coincidían con lo que el video decia
"Depplearning.AI: Please do not release content unless it is ready. The content is fine, but the assignments were clearly hastily put together and had basic bugs discussed all over in the forums. In particular, week 4 is a complete mess. Boiler-plate code that doesn't even relate student-content (to load a dataset) doesn't even run for many people. This wastes everyone's time. Really disappointing."
"I believe that there was an overload of information presented. I felt as though it was a continual run on sentence, just way to much and at some points it was just rambling it seemed like."
"Clear instruction, but quite easy. Would prefer if it was more challenging."
"content was fine and accessible, notebook environments were flakey"
I wish there was a better way to explain the material.
Appreciate the content so far. This can be though made more in-depth when it comes to hands on. Including graded level hands on practice can enhance the learning experience the students get from this course. Thanks for enabling us with all through the course.
Good content but the questions are badly worded and need updating.
"This course does a good job of introducing the basics of python. However, the slides in the lecture videos are so atrociously formatted (and riddled with typos), that they have an annoying and distracting effect. Even in a high school presentation these slides would be embarrassing."
"Some of the content is interesting, but there is not real feedback to improve the pronunciation and listening skills. I had to look for a dictionary to be able to hear the words when they could be here."
